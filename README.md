The Excel file contains daily GHCN Tmax data for June, July, August of 1911 through 2024 for Death Valley, CA stations plus all stations within 250 km of Greenland Ranch station (but also east of the Sierra Nevada). Only those stations with no more than 8 missing days in each July are included, and with no more than 2 sequential missing days at a time. Those missing 1-2 missing days are interpolated from the bounding days. Also included are various calculations, particularly of average temperature differences between Greenland Ranch station and all of the surrounding stations in each July, which combined with the averahe elevation difference between stations allows the temperature lapse rate to be computed for that July. The spreadsheet also includes data plots that were included in our Bulletin of the AMS article, "Death Valley Illusion: Evidence Against the 134 deg. F World Record".
